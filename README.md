Hi, I’m Rafael Pignataro and for the last 5 years I've been a Fullstack Web Developer.

I have a solid track record of building web applications with great performance and user experience. I’m very passionate about creative coding and realtime interaction-based projects.

Over the years I’ve had the opportunity to improve my experience working in multiple sectors, leading and participating in both small and large teams.

Currently I’m focused on Typescript, Node, Next/React, Tailwind & WebSockets. 

If you want to talk or get a project off the ground, feel free to get in touch.
